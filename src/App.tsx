              You are one of the most talented people I know, and I am
              consistently inspired by your dedication to your goals. I have no
              doubt that you will achieve whatever you set your mind to, and I
              cannot wait to help in whatever way I can.

              I don’t have very many straight friends (for various reasons), but
              you are such a kind, generous, and nonjudgmental person that I
              consider myself lucky to have you as one of my closest friends.
              You make me feel safe.
            </p>

              Your work is incredible. I wish I had a billion dollars so I could
              buy all of it. Ever since glass class I’ve been forever impressed
              by your blending of technique and concept. You have such a strong
              artistic voice that’s really apparent in everything you make, in
              the best way possible. I cannot wait to see how your work will
              continue to evolve.
            </p>

              You are so important to me Stephen. I am so thankful that you and
              I have gotten so much closer over the past few years. You are an
              absolutely gem of a person and we are all lucky to have you.
            </p>
            <p>I love you, and hope you have an incredible birthday.</p>
